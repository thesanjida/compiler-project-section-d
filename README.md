# About This Project

This project centers on enhancing code reliability and correctness by conducting syntax analysis, function verification, and type checking. By parsing source code from a .txt file, we identify syntax errors early, preventing runtime issues. Function verification ensures accurate function usage, minimizing logical errors. Comprehensive type checking confirms data type compatibility, reducing type-related bugs.

The project employs formal grammar and programming language theory to define rules for valid syntax and behavior. We use efficient data structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and algorithms such as recursive descent parsing for accurate analysis. Error reporting and feedback mechanisms provide developers with precise information for effective debugging.

Extensive testing with diverse scenarios ensures the system's accuracy and performance. In conclusion, our project offers a versatile tool for programmers to enhance code quality and reliability by addressing syntax, function, and type-related concerns, all derived from a simple .txt file input.
